# Microsoft's Azure Well-Architected Framework
Microsoft's Azure Well-Architected Framework is a set of quality-driven tenets, architectural decision points, and review tools that help solution architects build a technical foundation for their workloads. 

It provides a set of best practices and guidelines for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud. The framework consists of five pillars of architecture excellence: 
*  [Cost Optimization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/cost/)
*  [Operational Excellence](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/devops/overview/)
*  [Performance Efficiency](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/scalability/overview)
*  [Reliability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview)
*  [Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/security/overview)

 The framework helps organizations optimize their Azure workloads by providing a framework for reviewing and improving their architecture.
